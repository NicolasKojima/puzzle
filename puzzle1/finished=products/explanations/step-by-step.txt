This code attempts to solve a puzzle by placing various shapes on an 8x8 board,
considering all possible rotations and reflections of each shape. The goal is to
fill the board completely, except for a 2x2 center block, which is marked as occupied.
The script also measures the time taken and the number of attempts to find a solution.
The steps are as follows:

1. Define Shapes:
   - The code starts by defining a list of shapes. Each shape is represented as a list of coordinates,
     where each coordinate is a tuple (x, y).

2. Rotate and Mirror Functions:
   - Two functions, `rotate` and `mirror`, are defined to generate rotated and mirrored versions of a shape.
   - The `rotate` function rotates the shape 90 degrees clockwise.
   - The `mirror` function mirrors the shape horizontally.

3. Generate All Rotations and Mirrors:
   - The function `generate_all_rotations_and_mirrors` takes a shape and generates all possible rotations
     and mirrored versions of that shape.
   - This ensures that all unique transformations of a shape are considered.

4. Expand Shapes to Include All Variants:
   - The list `all_shapes` is created to store all possible rotations and mirrored versions for each shape.
   - This is done by applying the `generate_all_rotations_and_mirrors` function to each shape.

5. Board Placement Functions:
   - The `can_place` function checks if a shape can be placed at a specified position (x, y) on the board
     without overlapping existing shapes or going out of bounds.
   - The `place_shape` function places a shape on the board at the specified position
