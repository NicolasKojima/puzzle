# Explanation of the code with differences emphasized

This code attempts to solve a puzzle by placing various shapes on an 8x8 board,
considering all possible rotations and reflections of each shape. The goal is to
fill the board completely, except for a 2x2 center block, which is marked as occupied.
The script also measures the time taken and the number of attempts to find a solution.
The steps are as follows:

1. Define Shapes:
 
2. Rotate and Mirror Functions:

3. Generate All Rotations and Mirrors:

4. Expand Shapes to Include All Variants:

5. Board Placement Functions:

6. Check for Valid Empty Spaces:

7. Solve the Puzzle:

8. Initialize the Board:

9. Create a Custom Colormap:
   - A custom colormap (`custom_cmap`) is created using `plt.cm.tab20`, where the first color is set to white
     to represent unfilled spaces, and the second color is set to black to represent the center block.
   
10. Visualize the Board:
    - The `plot_board` function visualizes the board at each step where shapes are placed.
    - The center 2x2 block is always set to -1 (black) before plotting.

11. Measure Time and Attempts:

12. Display the Solution:


Differences from Previous Code:
1. **Visualization Update**: 
   - The `plot_board` function now ensures that the center 2x2 block is black, and uses a custom colormap to set
     the background of unfilled units to white.

2. **Custom Colormap**: 
   - The custom colormap is created such that the first color is white (for unfilled spaces) and the second color 
     is black (for the center block). This was not present in the previous code.

3. **Reduced Delay for Visualization**: 
   - The delay in the `plt.pause()` function is reduced to 0.0001 seconds for faster visualization of the solving 
     process.

4. **Explicit Handling of Center Block**:
   - The `plot_board` function explicitly sets the center 2x2 block to -1 before plotting, ensuring it is always
     displayed as black.
